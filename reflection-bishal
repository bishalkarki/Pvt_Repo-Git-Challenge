The git-challenge was an exercise which was both fun and frustrating at the same time. The idea of version control was really appealing when I heard it in class, however seemed like something which is very technical and difficult. Given the amount of experience and learning I have had in this limited time, I feel that with a little bit more work, I will have learned to safely backup different versions of my work and while I might encounter challenges, I won't be lost. Moreover the collaboration functions seem to be very appealing to me and think will be very handy in the future consulting projects that we will perform.
